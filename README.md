# my-calculator
First React-Native app

This is a simple calculator I did from scratch after an introduction to React-Native / Expo. 

The purpose was to apply what I learned regarding: 
 - the component
 - the styles
 - fonts loading
 - icons
 - interactions/data transfer from childs to parents components
